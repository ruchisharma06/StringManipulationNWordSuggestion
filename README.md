# String Manipulation and Word Suggestion

This project implements a word correction system that suggests potential corrections for input words. It uses the concept of edit distance to generate possible modifications to a given word and ranks suggestions based on their probability of being the intended word.

## Usage
Step 1: Implement the Your_Read_Function to read the vocabulary from a text file.

Step 2: Utilize the implemented functions like edit_distance_one, edit_distance_two, etc., in your application.

Step 3: Use the fix_edits function to get suggestions for a given word.

## Customization

Adjust the file structure and paths based on your project organization.

Customize the functions like Your_Read_Function for specific file reading needs.

Modify the vocabulary file path and other parameters as necessary.

## Note

Please replace placeholders like `your-username`, `/path/to/vocabulary.txt`, and adapt the file structure section based on your actual project structure. Additionally, add any further details or instructions that might be relevant to you.
